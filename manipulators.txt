We covered:

Addition and subtraction, using + and -
Multiplication and division, using * and /
The modulo operator for finding remainders, %
Compound assignment operators +=, -=, *=, /=, and %=.
The order of operations: parentheses -> exponents -> 
multiplication, division, modulo -> addition, subtraction
Greater than, >, and less than, <
Equal to, ==, and not equal to, !=
Greater than or equal to, >=, and less than or equal to, <=
equals() for comparing Strings and other objects
Using + to concatenate Strings
The final keyword which makes variables unchangeable
