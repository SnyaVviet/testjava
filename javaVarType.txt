Review
Creating and filling variables is a powerful concept that allows us to keep track of all kinds of data in our program.

In this lesson, we learned how to create and print several different data types in Java, which youâ€™ll use as you create bigger and more complex programs.

We covered:

int, which stores whole numbers.
double, which stores bigger whole numbers and decimal numbers.
boolean, which stores true and false.
char, which stores single characters using single quotes.
String, which stores multiple characters using double quotes.
